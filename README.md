# stickynoteapp


StickyNotesApp is a React-based web application that lets you create, edit, and manage sticky notes. Each note can be customized, downloaded, and locked for security, offering a simple and interactive user experience.

## Features
- Add new sticky notes.
- Edit notes with real-time updates.
- Delete notes with a single click.
- Download notes as `.txt` files.
- Lock notes to prevent editing.
- Notes are persisted using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the app.
- **React Icons**: Provides icons for the buttons.
- **CSS**: Styled using a modern and clean design.

## Installation and Setup
- `npm install` is used to install all the project dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `npm run start` is used to start the React development server, which by default runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

- ## Future Enhancements
As part of my thesis, I created this simple React app for sticky notes. In the future, I plan to:
- Add security and encryption features to enhance data protection.
- Developing similar apps in Angular and Vue, including their mobile application counterparts.
